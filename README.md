🌲 Redwood

Redwood is a TUI (Text User Interface) that turns your shell into a flight tracking station.

### Features
- **Different Modes:** A single-panel "spotter" mode that shows the current closest aircraft to you, plus a more detailed dashboard with a sorted list of closest aircraft. 
- **Auto-Geolocation:** Automatically geolocates to you and shows your current area. This can be turned off and you can configure a custom (or more exact) coordinate target area via `config.toml`.
